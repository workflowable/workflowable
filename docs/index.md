# Introduction
At its core, a workflow engine orchestrates the sequence of activities required to accomplish a specific task or achieve a particular outcome. It allows users to design and model complex workflows by defining the steps and conditions that govern the flow of work. These workflows can range from simple, linear processes to highly intricate and conditional ones involving multiple participants, decision points, and integrations with various systems.

> **Note**: This is an early release and is not ready for production usage. APIs are subject to change. This early release aims to gather feedback and design suggestions while the core development is in progress. Documentation will be added as the APIs stabilize.

# Workflow Events

A **workflow event** refers to a trigger that initiates a workflow process. It represents an event that
leads to the execution of workflow activities, the progression of work, or the activation of certain workflow activities.

Workflow events can be internal or external to the system or application hosting the workflow. They can be triggered by system events, user actions, time-based events, data changes, or any other event that requires the workflow engine to respond and execute the appropriate workflow activities.
